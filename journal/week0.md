    Cloud Security = protect data, apps, services in your Cloud envrionments from internal and external security threats
    1. Reduce impact of breach
    2. Protect networks, apps, services from data theft
    3. Reduce human error
    Cloud/Cloud security - takes practice due to complexity, new services, threat actors improving capability

    Enable MFA for root account - already done!
    MFA important as compromised domain admin account = game over
    Can double check byu going to main profile -> secruity credentials and review root user config
